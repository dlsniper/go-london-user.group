The Go London User Group makes an effort to organise a regular(ish!) event which aims to **share the passion** for the language and to **grow the community** around it. 

The events are announced on [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/Go-London-User-Group/) and participants can subscribe there.

**Call for paper!**
The Go London User Group wants to be supportive and inclusive, and regardless of your level of experience, if you want to talk at one of our events, don't hesitate to submit your talk [here](https://goo.gl/IN3BWq)!
