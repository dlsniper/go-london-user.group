We are organising our first [_**hack night**_](https://www.meetup.com/Go-London-User-Group/events/241545817/).

Please pre-register so that Skills Matter can plan for numbers on the night and we can start promptly: [**GLUG July Meetup - Hacknight**](https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/9810-glug-july-meetup-hacknight#community)

<h3>Programme:</h3>

- 6:30pm - Drinks, food and chat 
- 7:00pm - Hacknight Project Introductions
- 7:15pm - Get hacking!
- 8:45pm - Hiring shoutouts, Announcements, etc

<h3>Hacknight Format:</h3>

As this is our first time attempting this, the format is loose for the time being and very much open to ideas and suggestions.

<h3>You can either:</h3>

- **Submit** your project or an project that you would like to work a head of time to the [GLUG Github repo](https://github.com/go-london-user-group/hacknights/issues) as an issue

- Or, **simply show up** with your suggested project or idea

Then we select a handful of submissions for the night, and give the submitters a brief period of time to present their suggested project.

We then break into groups and get hacking!
