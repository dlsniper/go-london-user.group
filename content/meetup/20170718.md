We are organising our first _**hack night**_.

As this is our first time attempting this, the format is loose for the time being and very much open to ideas and suggestions.

You can either:

- **Submit** your project or an project that you would like to work a head of time to the [GLUG Github repo](https://github.com/go-london-user-group/hacknights/issues) as an issue
- Or, **simply show up** with your suggested project or idea

Then we select a handful of submissions for the night, and give the submitters a brief period of time to present their suggested project.

We then break into groups and get hacking!
